        <p>Not all falafel wraps are created equally. Some have better falafels, some have better sauces, while some have better toppings. For me it is about that perfectly herby falafel that's fresh out of the fryer, the crisp pickled turnip, and the falafel artist who knows the fine line between just enough and too much sauce. At the end of the day it is the maker of the falafel who holds all the power. </p>
